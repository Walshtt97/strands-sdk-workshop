    "In my first attempt, I tried creating 2 tools to enforce naming consistency and then letting `use_aws` run with it. I knew this solution would not be optimal, but I wanted to see if it would work. The agent could not succeed at this, but I learned quite alot about `use_aws`. My personal recommendation is to avoid this to outside of POC work, it is extremely greedy in how it opperates, deploying resources, failing and not cleaning up after its self. It will continue try and fail and try something new that will fail until it runs out of tokens. This is a great way to run up costs and lower the security of your aws environment. \n",

    "- Find PDF files on a website\n",
    "- Download the PDF files\n",
    "- Upload PDFs to S3 \n",
    "- Create/update the knowledge base\n",
    "\n",
    "When we think about this workflow, the only AI part of this work is identifying the PDF file urls un a website. Further we can assume that this is going to effectively amount to parsing html. `<a href=\"<pdf file link>\">`\n",
    "- Government websites especially for hunting can often be behind the times so vanilla html is not uncommon.\n",
    "- Strands provides a tool `http_request` which we can leverage for these vanilla sites\n",
    "- More modern Javascript webpages may be more difficult to parse, there are other Strands tools that could improve this in theory, but I couldn't get them configured to run in the time I had. \n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining workflow is algorithmic, so instead of leaving it up to the agent we can build tooling for this. Further, we want this to be a singular tool so that there is only 1 possible entry point for the agent to call. If we provided multiple tools we would need to add more instructions (probably numbered instructions) to enforce the order of opperations, but it would be hard to ensure that if a step failed the agent would not do the step after that.\n"
